            <p class="description">
                We, a group of four friends, designed a cybertruck prototype with a remote-controlled system. Our design was inspired by the need for transportation on Mars, with the entire body of the vehicle covered in a metal sheet to protect it from the Martian environment.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                Our future plans included adding thermal cameras and high-resolution normal vision cameras to provide a complete feed of the surroundings to the user inside and the control room. Although our design was based on Tesla's cybertruck, our version was more protective and completely remote-based, introducing a cyber world feel to the user inside.

            <p class="description">
                After the final demonstration of the project, we gifted it to our teachers, but they didn't understand the concept of the car and thought it was a toy for a child. One of the teachers even took it home for her child. However, I believe that one day they will see the same model car running on Mars, directing humanity into a new era of space exploration.
