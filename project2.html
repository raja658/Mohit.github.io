    <h1>Cybertruck Prototype: A Revolutionary Transportation Solution for Mars</h1>
    <p>
        Our team of four friends designed a cybertruck prototype with a remote-controlled system, inspired by the need for transportation on Mars. The entire body of the vehicle is covered in a metal sheet to protect it from the harsh Martian environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our further plans include adding thermal cameras and high-resolution normal vision cameras to provide a complete feed of the surroundings to the user inside and the control room. Although our design is based on Tesla's cybertruck, our version is more protective and completely remote-based, introducing a cyber world feel to the user inside.
    </p>
    <p>
        We envision a future where our cybertruck prototype plays a crucial role in humanity's exploration of Mars, providing a safe and efficient mode of transportation for astronauts and scientists.
