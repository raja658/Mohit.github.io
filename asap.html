    <h1>Alliance for Strategic Action to Pandemics (ASAP)</h1>
    <p>
        ASAP is an initiative to understand and learn more abot the pandemics that might have the capability to wipe out the humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
        ASAP was formed with the vision to prepare students with the knowledge and skills to combat pandemics. The students would also learn the process of handling pandemic situations. The students would begin spreading awareness among the childrens, elders, scholars, etc about the impacts of emerging pandemics. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Earlier, we begin to study about the "Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)". We studied research papers and had group meetings about the AMR. We even conducted presentation program in the college for students and faculties to spread awareness about the upcoming AMR pandemic.
    </p>
    <p> 
        Currently, ASAP is shutdown because of the lack of funds and necessary support and guidance needed from the college administration. Let's hope for better in the future. But if anyone is interested, we can collaborate and restart the mission again, even if no one is interetsed, anyhow the mission will restart again. Enthusiasts, Be in tune with us...
