    <h2>My Vision</h2>
    <p>Ideally, I am dreaming about the victory of scientific progress and popularity of technologies by which people are divided into religious, caste or simply personal classification. When imagining my dream, I would like to have people of all ranks, status, and occupations join society to bring passion in science and technology enthusiasts. Science to me should be the language that unites the divides and creates culture of understanding one another and problem solving.</p>
    <p>In order to achieve this vision, I recommend a coordinated, systematic strategy in which coherent, well-coordinated and well-supported science is accepted as the integrating strand through the social fabric. I kindly appeal to all the people to come with me in this mission to make science as the compass of the world.</p>
    <p>Collectively, we can all strive to a world and existence where science and technological advancement is not only a process, but a lifestyle. As scientists, it is our duty to try to construct a world where people have at least this basic similarity in their interest–science.</p>
